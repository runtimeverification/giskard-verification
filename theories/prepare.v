(** * Safety property one: Prepare stage height injectivity *)

(** ** Prepare stage height injectivity definition *)

(** Recall that a block is in prepare stage in some local state iff it has
received quorum PrepareVote messages or a PrepareQC message in the current
view or some previous view. *) 

(** The first safety property states that no two same height blocks can be
at prepare stage in the same view, i.e., prepare stage block height is injective
in the same view. The first safety property differs from the following two in that
it contains an additional premise restricting the view during which the two blocks
reached prepare stage. This is important because it is possible for multiple blocks
at the same height to reach prepare stage across different views in the case of
abnormal view changes. *)

(** In any global state i in a valid protocol trace tr that begins with the initial
state and respects the protocol transition rules, if there are two participating
nodes n and m, and two blocks b1 b2, such that b1 and b2 have the same height,
and both reach prepare stage for n and m's local state respectively in some view p,
but are not equal, then we can prove a contradiction. *)

Definition prepare_stage_same_view_height_injective_statement :=
  forall (tr : GTrace),
    protocol_trace tr ->
    forall (i : nat) (n m : node) (b1 b2 : block) (p : nat),
      In n participants ->
      In m participants ->
      b1 <> b2 ->
      prepare_stage_in_view (fst (tr i) n) p b1 -> 
      prepare_stage_in_view (fst (tr i) m) p b2 ->      
      b_height b1 = b_height b2 ->
      False.

(** ** Reducing the proof *)

(** Intuitively, the proof of this property follows directly from the definition of
non-Byzantine/honest voting behavior: honest nodes cannot vote for two conflicting
blocks during the same view. If two conflicting blocks reach prepare stage in the
same view, then two quorums of at least 2/3 validators voted for each block.
By the pigeonhole principle, there must exist a set of at least 1/3 validators who
voted for both conflicting blocks and are therefore Byzantine/dishonest. By assumption,
there are no more than 1/3 Byzantine/dishonest blocks. Therefore, we reach a contradiction. *)

(** The formal proof proceeds by identifying a series of conditions that can both prove
that there exist more than 1/3 dishonest nodes (bottom-up) and be proven from the
node-local premises (top-down), and leverages the global broadcast message buffer,
which can be viewed as a ghost variable. Starting with the bottom-up direciton, we
first identify the most obvious sufficient condition for a node to be dishonest:
a node n is dishonest if there exist two equivocating messages in its own local
out-message buffer. *)

(** Local evidence of malice. **) 
Definition equivocating_in_state (s : NState) : Prop :=
  exists (msg1 msg2 : message),
    In msg1 (out_messages s) /\
    In msg2 (out_messages s) /\
    get_view msg1 = get_view msg2 /\
    get_message_type msg1 = PrepareVote /\
    get_message_type msg2 = PrepareVote /\
    get_block msg1 <> get_block msg2 /\
    b_height (get_block msg1) = b_height (get_block msg2).

(** However, it turns out that this obvious definition of local evidence of malice is
not the weakest precondition for a node being dishonest: there is a sufficient condition
yet for local evidence of malice. Giskard's transition rules forbid nodes from processing
PrepareBlock messages for conflicting blocks. This in turn prevents nodes from sending
PrepareVote messages for conflicting blocks at the get-go: nodes can only send a PrepareVote
message for a block if they have received the corresponding PrepareBlock message for that
block. Therefore, a malicious node can be detected by the presence of two conflicting
PrepareBlock messages in its processed message buffer. *)

(** If a node has sent a PrepareVote message for some block, then it must have
processed a PrepareBlock message for that block in the same view. *)
